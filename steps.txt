Here’s the exact, simple flow you can follow and send to users.

Build on your PC (once)
1) CPU‑only (works on any PC):
```powershell
.\build_windows_cpu.ps1
```
This creates: `dist_cpu\FlaskTranscriber\`

2) Optional: create one‑file installer:
```powershell
.\build_installer.ps1 -Flavor cpu
```
This creates: `dist_installer\FlaskTranscriber_Setup.exe`

What file/folder you send
Option A (no installer, just folder):
- Send the entire folder `dist_cpu\FlaskTranscriber\`

Option B (installer, one file):
- Send `dist_installer\FlaskTranscriber_Setup.exe`

What the user does
Option A (folder):
1. Copy the folder anywhere (Desktop is fine).
2. Run `FlaskTranscriber.exe`.
3. Browser opens automatically.

Option B (installer):
1. Run `FlaskTranscriber_Setup.exe`.
2. It installs, creates Start Menu + optional Desktop shortcut.
3. Run it from the shortcut; browser opens automatically.

If you want to include your existing notes for them:
- Copy `notes.db` and the `uploads` folder into the `dist_cpu\FlaskTranscriber\` folder before you send it.

That’s all. If you want the installer to show your name/version or a custom icon, tell me what to set.
